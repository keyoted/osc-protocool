[X]             h - 64 bit big-endian two's complement integer
[X]             d - 64 bit ("double") IEEE 754 floating point number
[X]             S - Alternate type represented as an OSC-string (for example, for systems that differentiate "symbols" from "strings")
[X]             c - An ascii character, sent as 32 bits
[X]             r - 32 bit RGBA color
