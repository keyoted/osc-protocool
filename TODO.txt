[ ]     Implement 1.1 type
[ ]             T - True. No bytes are allocated in the argument data.
[ ]             F - False. No bytes are allocated in the argument data.
[ ]             N - Nil. No bytes are allocated in the argument data.
[ ]             I - Infinitum. No bytes are allocated in the argument data.

[ ]             h - 64 bit big-endian two's complement integer
[ ]             d - 64 bit ("double") IEEE 754 floating point number
[ ]             S - Alternate type represented as an OSC-string (for example, for systems that differentiate "symbols" from "strings")
[ ]             c - An ascii character, sent as 32 bits
[ ]             r - 32 bit RGBA color
